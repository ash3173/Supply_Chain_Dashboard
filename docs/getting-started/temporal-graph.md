# Temporal Graph Class
# to be replaced by balaji

The `TemporalGraphClass` is a core component that handles the temporal aspects of supply chain networks.

## Overview

This class implements the temporal graph data structure and provides methods for:
- Managing time-based graph relationships
- Processing supply chain network data
- Analyzing temporal patterns

## Usage

```python
from TemporalGraphClass import TemporalGraph

# Initialize temporal graph
graph = TemporalGraph()

# Add temporal data
graph.add_temporal_data(data)

# Process relationships
graph.process_relationships()
```

## Key Methods

### add_temporal_data
Adds temporal data to the graph structure.

### process_relationships
Processes and analyzes relationships between nodes over time.

### get_temporal_slice
Retrieves a snapshot of the graph at a specific time point.
